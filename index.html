      <h2>About Script-Beam</h2>
      <p>Expaning the idea of execution.</p>
      <p>
        We started Script-Beam a few days after Synapse X announced their quit
        and moving sides to the Roblox Anticheat. We knew how much the people
        loved Synapse and wanted to make something the community could use based
        on it. We then came up with Script-Beam. The new best way to bypass both
        Synapse and Byfron.
